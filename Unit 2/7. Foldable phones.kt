/*7. Foldable phonesTypically, a phone screen turns on and off when the power button is pressed. In contrast, if a foldable phone is folded, the main inner screen on a foldable phone doesn't turn on when the power button is pressed.In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a FoldablePhone class that inherits from the Phone class. It should contain the following:A property that indicates whether the phone is folded.A different switchOn() function behavior than the Phone class so that it only turns the screen on when the phone isn't folded.Methods to change the folding state.class Phone(var isScreenLightOn: Boolean = false){    fun switchOn() {        isScreenLightOn = true    }        fun switchOff() {        isScreenLightOn = false    }        fun checkPhoneScreenLight() {        val phoneScreenLight = if (isScreenLightOn) "on" else "off"        println("The phone screen's light is $phoneScreenLight.")    }}*/class Phone(var isScreenLightOn: Boolean = false){    fun switchOn() {        isScreenLightOn = true    }        fun switchOff() {        isScreenLightOn = false    }        fun checkPhoneScreenLight() {        val phoneScreenLight = if (isScreenLightOn) "on" else "off"        println("The phone screen's light is $phoneScreenLight.")    }}class FoldablePhone() : Phone() {    var isFolded: Boolean = false        override fun switchOn() {        if(!isFolded) {            super.switchOn()        }    }        fun fold() {        isFolded = true    }        fun unfold() {        isFolded = false    }}
